At the end of July the news broke of the latest wave of UK city deals. One of the key packages for Edinburgh was a £300m fund for developing data innovation. The press release from the University of Edinburgh (a key partner in the deal) heralded the founding of a Edinburgh as the ['Data Capital of Europe'](http://www.ed.ac.uk/news/2017/university-to-play-pivotal-role-in-creating-data-c).

All exciting stuff, but as I read the release I was left with plenty of questions - e.g. what's meant by data skills?

"The University will partner with local authorities, schools and employers across the region to create the workforce of the future by supporting a massive increase in the provision of data skills." 

Or indeed, data driven innovation?

"With the University at its centre, the City Deal’s data driven innovation (DDI) programme will give businesses and people in Edinburgh and its surrounding areas maximum advantage in the data revolution."

Mostly the piece implies that all this will be achieved by the application and upskilling in data science: 

"Over 10 years, the University and its partners will train 100,000 people in the application of data across the region’s major industry sectors. It will work with the private and public sectors to grow awareness of data science’s implications."

A city full of data scientists isn't a bad thing, but does a city of surgeons make a healthcare capital? 

It's likely I'm reading a lot into a single press release, but questions have to be asked as there's a huge opportunity, (and many of your tax dollars too. 

Much of what I was going to put down here has been better said by [Prof. Bill Buchannan](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/edinburgh-should-become-smartest-city-world-please-prof-bill/?trackingId=A8gUjmxYg65PMzsBsZKR4A%3D%3D&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_content%3BMLb7sYA0SfK1eL20HY53Lg%3D%3D&licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_content-object) in a post he published **yesterday**.

In all the city deal literature I can find, 'data' is being treated as a distinct technology product that can be installed by an expert and forgotten about. There's the image of data scientists going out to communities, businesses, and council offices installing a ,  and then leaving a productivity boost in their wake.  

 It's a bit like we'll   Unfortunately this metaphor doesn't work.
